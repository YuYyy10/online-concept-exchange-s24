            <p>
              There was a time when children and teens could see and experience
              friends and neighbors working together to make our communities a
              better place for everyone to live.
            </p>

            <p>
              While it is true that there were the barriers of prejudice,
              oppression, and inequality in our collective history, there were
              also more chances than today for children to see people working
              together in their village.
            </p>

            <p>
              Children could see people building houses with each other, growing
              and harvesting food with one other, and chipping in to help when
              there was crisis and illness.
            </p>

          <div class="card-text">
            <p>
              Community cohesion is not as visible for our youth today, with
              more of our time spent in separate homes, vehicles, delivery
              services, and the need to socially distance due to Covid-19.
            </p>
            <p>
              Children and teens too often suffer from bullies and lack of
              meaningful opportunities. We have problems we can't solve well
              unless we all choose to work together with our personal best and a
              clear understanding of a goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we consider the lessons we have learned as a human family, it
              seems past time that we stop making the same mistakes that cause
              preventable harm. Somehow, after all this time, many students
              don't understand that they're valuable and needed.

            <p>
              <strong>The Human Domino Effect</strong> is a project that
              involves community partners, schools, and families as they work
              together to build an online game that reveals what community is
              and how a well-functioning community can solve big problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game provides a fun opportunity for students to stack up a
              model with fun building blocks to demonstrate how we are each
              needed in the process of creating well-functioning homes, schools,
              and workplaces that combine to make great communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Helping students learn the attributes of each building block is a
              way to respect their individual dignity and brilliance. Then, they
              can choose where they fit in the movement to make a difference!

                      The color of each stone is determined by:
                      1. the (inner) loop index, which increments with each stone (loop indexes start at 1, not 0!)
                      2. the (outer) loop index, which maintains the count when the round increments (10 stones in each round)
                      3. the number of colors available (6 colors that loop, see index.css)

                      Example: the 3rd stone in Round 2 is (3 - 1) + (2 * 10)) % 6 = 22 % 6 = stone-4
                                                move index to 0 ^
